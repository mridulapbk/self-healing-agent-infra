# Self-Healing Agent Infrastructure

## Overview

Self-Healing Agent Infrastructure is a distributed workflow orchestration platform designed to evaluate fault tolerance and automated recovery in modern cloud-native systems. The platform simulates resilient agents capable of detecting failures, recovering from disruptions, and maintaining workflow execution without manual intervention.

Built using Golang, Redis, PostgreSQL, Docker, and Next.js, the system combines distributed task processing, durable queues, configurable recovery strategies, benchmarking, and real-time monitoring to demonstrate self-healing behavior in distributed environments.

Experimental evaluation processed over **620 workflow executions**, achieving an **84.52% workflow success rate** while automatically recovering **239 failed executions** through self-healing recovery mechanisms.
